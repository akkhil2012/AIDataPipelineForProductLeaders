# AI Data Pipeline for Product Leaders

AI Data Pipeline for Product Leaders is a learning and reference project that shows product, data, and engineering teams how to stand up a modular data platform that is ready for AI-powered insights. It combines Spring Boot microservices, Python orchestration utilities, and supporting product collateral so you can demo, prototype, or tailor the pipeline to your own organization.

## Why this project matters for Product Managers
- **Accelerate AI feature discovery.** The pipeline demonstrates how raw product usage data can be cleansed, enriched, and exposed for downstream AI models—helping product managers validate new intelligent features quickly.
- **Quantify ROI.** The included `GenAI_UseCases_ROI_Pipeline.pdf` and presentation assets describe a framework for measuring value and prioritizing AI use cases with stakeholders
- **Bridge product and engineering conversations.** Each microservice mirrors a stage in a typical product data lifecycle, giving PMs a tangible way to discuss requirements, data contracts, and service level expectations with technical partners.
- **Support governance and trust.** Data lineage, deduplication, and quality checks are first-class citizens, ensuring AI initiatives respect compliance and customer expectations.

## Microservice architecture
The Spring Boot applications are organized as six independently deployable services that share a consistent layered architecture (controller, service, repository, model). Each service exposes CRUD APIs plus helper endpoints that can call out to Python FastAPI processes for specialized processing or validation. Ports and responsibilities:

| Service | Port | Responsibility |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Data Ingestion | `8081` | Accepts raw product telemetry or transactional events. |
| Data Deduplication | `8082` | Removes duplicate records based on source identifiers. |
| Data Quality | `8083` | Validates fields against business rules before downstream use. |
| Data Normalization | `8084` | Standardizes formats (currency, SKU, statuses) and enriches timestamps. |
| Data Storage | `8085` | Persists curated data and attaches lineage metadata. |
| Data Consumption | `8086` | Serves ready-for-analysis datasets to analytics or AI services. |

The shared architecture unlocks fast onboarding for new engineers, consistent observability (health checks, metrics, logging), and predictable integration patterns for adjacent systems.

## Orchestration pipeline
The `pipeline/` folder provides a Python CLI (`run_pipeline.py`) and config-driven YAML definitions to exercise every microservice stage in sequence. Sample data (`sample_data.json`) includes duplicates and intentional quality issues so the pipeline demonstrates realistic transformations during a run. You can dry-run the orchestration with `--simulate` to validate connectivity before spinning up the Java services.

### Running the full stack locally
1. **Start the microservices**
   ```bash
   cd CompleteDataPipeline/data-platform-springboot-microservices
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   Or run each service individually with `mvn spring-boot:run` from its directory.
2. **Install orchestration dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install requests pyyaml
   ```
3. **Execute the pipeline**
   ```bash
   python pipeline/run_pipeline.py --log-level INFO
   ```
   Use `--simulate --log-level DEBUG` when the services are offline to see the payload transformations without sending HTTP requests.

### Development and operations highlights
- Consistent REST API surface: each service supports CRUD operations plus `/process` and `/validate` endpoints for Python-driven workflows.
- Built-in monitoring hooks: Spring Boot Actuator endpoints (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`) expose runtime telemetry out of the box.
- Configurable data stores: H2 in-memory databases ship as defaults; swap them for PostgreSQL, MySQL, or cloud data warehouses for production deployments.
- Deployment flexibility: run locally with Maven, containerize with Docker Compose, or package JARs for your preferred orchestration platform.
  
## Using the project in product strategy conversations
1. **Prioritize AI-enabled scenarios.** Use the ROI framework to align leadership on which product experiences to automate first; map those scenarios to the pipeline stages to clarify data needs and service-level agreements.【F:CompleteDataPipeline/data-platform-springboot-microservices/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md†L1-L20】
2. **Design measurable outcomes.** Instrument the pipeline so quality, freshness, and consumption metrics become OKRs for the AI initiative. The orchestrator’s stage summaries provide sample telemetry you can extend into dashboards or alerts.【F:CompleteDataPipeline/data-platform-springboot-microservices/pipeline/README.md†L45-L63】
3. **Plan governance upfront.** Share the lineage validation Streamlit app and governance notes template with privacy, compliance, and legal stakeholders to demonstrate how data will remain trustworthy and auditable.【F:CompleteDataPipeline/data-platform-springboot-microservices/DataLineageStage/README1.md†L1-L33】
4. **Enable cross-functional collaboration.** The microservice architecture mirrors common product lifecycle milestones (capture, cleanse, enrich, deliver). Use it as a blueprint for writing PRDs, clarifying hand-offs between data and AI teams, and creating incremental delivery plans.【F:CompleteDataPipeline/data-platform-springboot-microservices/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md†L21-L70】

## Extending the solution
- **Add new stages.** Duplicate an existing microservice and update `pipeline_config.yaml` plus `run_pipeline.py` to insert additional transformations or AI inference steps.【F:CompleteDataPipeline/data-platform-springboot-microservices/pipeline/README.md†L67-L75】
- **Integrate real-time inputs.** Swap the ingestion service for a streaming source (Kafka, Pub/Sub) and update downstream services to handle event-driven contracts.
- **Automate compliance reporting.** Enrich the storage or consumption services with automated lineage reports, tying into governance platforms your organization already uses.
- **Ship product-facing analytics.** The `ui/` folder inside the microservices project contains a Streamlit application scaffold you can evolve into customer- or stakeholder-facing dashboards.【0adb49†L1-L4】

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the project and adapt the services, pipeline orchestrator, or collateral for your organization. Suggested next steps include adding authentication, integrating a production-grade database, and setting up CI/CD automation as described in the microservice overview guide.【F:CompleteDataPipeline/data-platform-springboot-microservices/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md†L145-L167】
